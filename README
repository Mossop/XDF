eXtensible Discussion Forum
---------------------------

This is the base directory for the XDF project. It was spawned from the
PhpBoard project when it was realised that the design made the board consist
of too much hard code. Much of the code used to update the code will be
carried across, but most of the presentation code will be lost in favour of
new methods.

The new project will make extensive use of XML and XSLT. A php script will
handle any updating of the forum and format any data in an xml document. An
XSLT stylesheet will then be used to format this data for the users browser.

Unlike the PhpBoard project, the themes will not be made up of php scripts
but rather a collection of XSLT stylesheets. The user will also be able to
select a theme to use rather then the theme being set by the board.
